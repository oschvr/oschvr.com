While my studies merged technology with art, I always enjoy taking deep dive into globalization, markets, politics, economy, finance and of course, computer science computer. Learning, reading and consulting the internet for very specific information is one of my greatest privileges as a modern era individual. While for me it's mostly technical books, once in a while I take delight in a great novel. :grin:

I believe in the betterment of the human race through technology and seriously consider that the roots to the best era of our times are near. :space_invader:
