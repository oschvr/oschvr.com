Hey 👋, I'm _Oscar_.

## ME

Another citizen of this wonderful planet 🌍, that was born in Mexico 🇲🇽 {{< myAge >}} years ago (of course I like tacos 🌮).

I'm based between Brussels, BEL 🇧🇪 and London, UK 🇬🇧.
I'm also a dad 👦🏼👼🏼 and I speak Spanish 🇲🇽, English 🇬🇧 and French 🇫🇷 (in that order).

I always repeat these (not really mine but I've adopted them as my principles):

•⁠ **Finished, not perfect**: It's best to have something that works to show where your effort and energy has gone into, than a never ending story of a prototype or an idea that "has" to be perfect. **Nothing is perfect** !

•⁠ ⁠**One thing at a time**: I'm of the idea that if you focus all your attention, energy and dedication into the task or the problem at hand, you'll be much more likely to succeed. Or as I saw somewhere else, "single-thread things"

•⁠ ⁠**To go fast, you must go slow**: So in 2021 I had a [TIA (stroke)](/posts/stroke) and specifically the recovery process, made me live this piece of advice. Go see the post for more but in a nutshell, if you really want to go fast in any direction, you need to be somewhat careful and meticulous deciding what steps to take. Otherwise you risk a fall or a misstep that will, slow you more. This, I found, is particularly useful for when you step into the unknown/uncertain.

## WORK

I've done a lot of on-site, remote and temporary contract jobs with clients from UK 🇬🇧, Europe 🇪🇺, Mexico 🇲🇽, but also from US 🇺🇸

Meetups, events and conferences are something I'm always looking to assist or participate in. I'm always up to help the industry grow, give some career advice and meet amazing people 😎.
