---

Over the past couple months I've been toying with the idea of combining content creation and my knowledge of cloud infrastructure engineering and having fun.

In terms of content creation... Yes I know that it's the most saturated, overcrowded space one could get into these days...

And if you're reading this, you're probably thinking that this is yet another content channel about how to do Infrastructure as Code.

_But hear me out_: What mostly drove me to start this, was the third aspect of the idea, and the one I wish to preseve the most throughout this experiment. To have fun !

So a _content channel around having fun with cloud infrastructure_ ? EXACTLY ! And I've decided to name it _InstantInfra_,

### WHAT

    ⁠*InstantInfra*: Oscar's cloud infrastructure playground.

>

    ⁠A fun-focused content channel exploring cloud infrastructure through hands-on experiments, Infrastructure as Code challenges, and other deployments across multiple cloud providers

### WHY

I mean, why not? I have, what I think, sufficient reasons to do it

•⁠ ⁠Doing something complex for the sake of it, enjoy the process and learn a lot from it. It's close to my personal definition of fun.
•⁠ ⁠Wanting to prove myself that I can execute my own crazy ideas. Nothing is more satisfiying and accomplishing I think
•⁠ ⁠I want to become very very good with Terraform/OpenTofu (and whatever comes with it, be it Python, Bash or any other)
•⁠ ⁠Fortunately, I'm in a great position to explore my hobby, and I want to share it with the world.
•⁠ ⁠Again, I'm yearning for learning new things and by doing this publicly, inevitably someone from the audience will suggest a better approach of what I'm doing. That is absolutely golden in my opinion.

### HOW

So with all the reasons aside, this is my initial format (and something that is very likely to evolve)

    ⁠A blog post with a 1:1 video (screensharing) of me going through the content

The content can be any these:

•⁠ ⁠*How to's*:

- How to setup your local environment like mine
- Initial setup and helper repository for multicloud
- How to setup a {cloud} account with Terraform/OpenTofu
  •⁠ ⁠*Infra Roulette*:
- Randomly pick one deployment from a list of architectures (Simple VM, Storage bucket, K8s cluster, etc)
- Randomly pick one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, etc)
- Timebox myself to N (10,20,30) minutes
- Record and see if I can get it in the time alotted.
  •⁠ ⁠*Infra AInferno (I might not do this ¯\\\(ツ)\/¯)*:
- Randomly pick one deployment from a list of architectures (Simple VM, Storage bucket, K8s cluster, etc)
- Randomly pick one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, etc)
- Attempt to "one-shot" prompt the solution and then blindly apply

That's it. See you soon for the first one ✌️!
