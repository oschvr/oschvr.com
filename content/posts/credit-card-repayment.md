So as my current role of CTO of (Incredible)[https://getincredible.com], I've been on a quest to truly and fully understand credit as a consumer product. We are on a mission to make credit work for our users.

I don't think it makes sense to cover what is credit card borrowing here as I am only interested in the dynamics that banks and credit card providers offer to users to manage them. Specifically, I'm interested in figuring out how do these rules play against their users to trap them and make sure to extract as much value as possible

I don't want to claim here that credit card is **bad** or **evil**, absolutely not, I am more of the opinion that if not used properly and without the knowledge of the rules of repayment, it can become a nightmare to deal with (debt)

Anyways, I've been documenting myself with as much as information on the matter as I can get my hands on and recently I stumbled upon a paper called (`Minimum payments and debt paydown in consumer credit cards`)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.09.009] by Benjamin J. Keys, Jialan Wang published in the Journal of Financial Economics. In it there was a couple of sentences that caught my total attention:

> While numerous papers have focused on the credit card borrowing decision, repayment has received relatively less attention.
> ~29% of the accounts make repayments at or near the minimum payment.

The data used is 1/4 of the U.S. credit card market, that is, and according to perplexity.ai:

> The U.S. general-purpose credit card market size in 2024 was approximately $190 billion and is expected to grow to around $206.2 billion in 2025. One quarter of this 2025 market size would be about $51.55 billion [psmarketresearch](https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/us-credit-card-market-report)

So, assuming I got everything right:
_~29% of accounts whose balance sum *$51.55 billion* of credit card debt, make less or exactly the minimum payment requested in their monthly cycle statements_

---

Now, as I understand, this paper attempts to describe the psychology of credit card consumers when repaying their credit card debt. Again, as I understood, the analysis is divided between transactors (people that pay in full their cards each cycle) and revolvers (people that pay relative to their minimum, and or carry balance)

> Anchoring to minimum payments on debt contracts can lead to lower payments, higher interest costs, and higher default rates, so our results highlight minimum payments as a potential target for regulators and innovators aiming to improve financial health.
